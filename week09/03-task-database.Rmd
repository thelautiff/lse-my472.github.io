# Creating and querying a SQL database

Practice creating a SQL database and querying it. You should use the data in the file UK-tweets.csv. These data represent a random sample of 10,000 tweets related to the 2014 EP elections in the UK.

1. Create a SQLite database from the data in the file. Test the database by checking the first 5 entries in it.

```{r}

```

2. How many tweets are classified as engaging? (HINT: Use CASE WHEN)

```{r}

```

3. What perecent of tweets are classified as impolite?

```{r}

```

4. What percent of tweets mention Brexit?

```{r}

```


5. Compute the average number of followers for tweets that are impolite and polite.

```{r}

```
