# Subqueries in SQL


## Facebook database

Use the SQLite database with Facebook posts data we created and used in week 10 to complete the questions below.

## Subqueries

In SQL, you can run a nested query where you use a result from the first query as a condition for the second query. Here, we will find the top 3 most frequent posters in congress and then get all messages from them. 

```{r}
# load required libraries and connect to facebook-db.sqlite

```

1. What are the screen names of the top 3 posters?
```{r}

```

2. (Without subquery) how can you get the posts from these congress members?
```{r}

```

3. Now, instead of hardcoding the screen_names in the conditional statement, use the query results in #1 as the subquery. 
```{r}

```

4. Using a subquery, get the average number of likes per post for all women Democrats.
```{r}

```

5. Now use a join to do the same as in #4.
```{r}

```

6. Which solution is faster: the one in #4 or #5?

```{r}

```
